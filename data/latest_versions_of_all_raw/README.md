## Datasets:
The study's two primary datasets are GSC1 ([gsc1_stem_with_featurecounts_RNAseq_entire_gene.npy](gsc1_stem_with_featurecounts_RNAseq_entire_gene.npy)) and GSC2 ([gsc2_stem_with_featurecounts_RNAseq_entire_gene.npy](gsc2_stem_with_featurecounts_RNAseq_entire_gene.npy)).

The additonal files present in this folder are non-overlapping gene subsets of GSC1 and GSC2. There are 10 subset datasets for each of the primary datasets.
